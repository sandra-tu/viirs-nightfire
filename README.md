# viirs-nightfire

I am not able to share the code contents of the repository containing this project due to company development reasons, but I will demo the functionality and appearance of the project here!

The Visual Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire [dataset](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnf/) consists of near-infrared and short-wave infrared data collected every night. Without sunlight interference, detected points can be fully attributed to combustion sources including wildfires, gas flares, and volcanoes. The purpose of the visualisation platform is to be able to easily query and visualise the Nightfire data by date, as well as identifying trends in areas of interest.
