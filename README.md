# viirs-nightfire

I am not able to share the code contents of the repository containing this project due to company development reasons, but I will demo the functionality and appearance of the project here!

The Visual Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire dataset consists of near-infrared and short-wave infrared data collected every night.
